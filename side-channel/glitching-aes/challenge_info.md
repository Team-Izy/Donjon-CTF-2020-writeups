I am targeting a board which runs an AES. That's the perfect target to test my brand new glitcher! I did a lot of acquisitions, and a lot of glitching! 

The results of my campaign are in [this file](https://cdn.donjon-ctf.io/campaign_results.txt). 

Could you help me retrieve the secret key?

Decrypt the following message, in ECB mode, with the secret key to get the flag: 
```2801dd800e7ae333258224d5cbfc5420ec72a12256bdff61814972c7f93948f8```
